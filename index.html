      design which achieves nothing is bad design. Design which only weights visual form as it's objective is bad design. Graphic design has a tendency toward arbritary decisions on form based on aesthetic sensibilities - decisions which hold no external connections to situate it within a global context. through the neo-liberal relationship design has with the world, it has escaped the need to justify it's existence in the same way that's expected of other contemporary art forms. The democratisation of design has removed the ability to justify it's own being with aesthetic impact alone. no more Helvetica posters. no more sans-serif minimal text logos. design which achieves nothing is bad design. design which only weights visual form as it's objective is bad design. the misconception of design possessing no physical footprint has accelerated the process. a website which exists in a digital realm holds no consequences to exist. but the cloud inhabits physical space. the internet inhabits physical space. these mediums are not purely intangible mediums. the internet does not exist in an ethereal realm with no materiality. the internet relies on masses of physical architecture and processors and microchips which inhabit physical space. the cloud has mass. the internet has mass. design which achieves nothing is bad design. design which only weights visual form as it's objective is bad design. no more bad design. 09.08.2023.
